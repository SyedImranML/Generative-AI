# Generative-AI
Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence designed to produce new content, such as text, 
images, music, or even code, based on patterns it has learned from existing data. Unlike traditional AI, 
which is primarily rule-based or predictive, generative AI creates novel outputs that can mimic human creativity. 
It uses complex models, particularly deep learning and neural networks, to generate these outputs.
